            <h2>Our Classes</h2>
            <h3>Math</h3>
            <p>This course prepares students for the AMC 8/10 contest. The course is around AMC 10 level. There will be 4 sections to this class each of which last three weeks. In the first three weeks, we will cover topics in algebra. Through the next three weeks, we will go over counting. The next three weeks will be focused on geometry and we will finish off the last three weeks with number theory. Each class will be 90 minutes long. We plan to use the first 15 minutes correcting homework from the previous week and then we will have a short quiz of 3 questions from the previous chapter for the next 15 minutes. For the next hour we wil go over the subject planned for the day the rest of the time. This course is thought by a multiple time AIME qual, and multiple honor roll for AMC 10, and a honor roll in AMC 8. Below attached is the syllabus:</p>
            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>This course prepares students to master the language of python. The course will 12 weeks long. Each class will be 90 minutes long, and we will use the first 15 minutes for correcting homework.

            <h3>Chess</h3>
            <p>This course will start off with the first 3 sessions as tryouts to determine the level for the student. Based on their scores on the tryouts, we will split the students into three groups, with ratings 0-600, 600-1000, and 1000-1300. This course is thought by many qualified chess players with ratings over 1500+. The classes for the 0-600 group will be around 45 minutes, th 600-1000 group will meet for 60 minutes, and the 1000-1300 group will meet for 90 minutes.
